Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

WARNING: [DRC DPIP-1] Input pipelining: DSP home_screen/rom_address input home_screen/rom_address/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC DPIP-1] Input pipelining: DSP home_screen/rom_address2 input home_screen/rom_address2/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net doodle_instance/Ball_Y_next__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin doodle_instance/Ball_Y_next_reg[9]_i_2/O, cell doodle_instance/Ball_Y_next_reg[9]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
